This functionality plugin saves all essential data functionality like custom post types and taxonomies.

The Staff Member custom post type is included along with a Staff Type taxonomy distinguishing between Directors, Executives, Full-time, and Summer staff members. 

The Activities custom post type is also included along with an Activity Type taxonomy distinguishing between Evening Activities, Camp Games, and Day Activities.

The Camp Programs custom post type is included which defines the tabs on the Camp Programs page as well as their contents.

For this plugin to function correctly, Custom Field Suites are used (Custom Field Suite Plugin)

(like Activities, Camp Programs, etc) as well as all custom taxonomies for organizing them (i.e.: activities, evening activities, and camp games for organizing the Activities post type) in the event the theme is changed although it is not recommended to change to a generic theme as many custom styles and scripts have been written that maintain essential style that wouldn't be present in a non-custom theme.




Formatting and Layout is designed to be robust and anticipate future growth.
