## Description
A Wordpress theme built specifically for Evans Lake.

After an extensive User Interface design process and User Experience testing phase, this theme simplifies menus and data to facilitate the workflow of likely personas. It provides a consistent, simplified aesthete to improve the experience and increase engagement.

The included functionality plugin saves all essential data functionality like custom post types (like Activities, Camp Programs, etc) as well as all custom taxonomies for organizing them (i.e.: activities, evening activities, and camp games for organizing the Activities post type) in the event the theme is changed although it is not recommended to change to a generic theme as many custom styles and scripts have been written that maintain essential style that wouldn't be present in a non-custom theme.

Formatting and Layout is designed to be robust and anticipate future growth.
